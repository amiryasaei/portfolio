                    <p>
                        I am a Mechatronics engineering student at University of Waterloo.
                        Although I have taken several mechanical and eletrical courses in 
                        my curriculum; however, I have always tried to keep my coop experiences
                        and my personal projects to be in the field that I am more passionate about,
                        software. Right now, I am browsing different aspects of software development
                        to find the best role that suits me the most.<br/>
